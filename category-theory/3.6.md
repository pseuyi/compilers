bool { true, false }
a set-theoretical monoid has 2 properties:
* has an associative, binary operator (mappend)
* has a neutral element (mempty)

bool monoid with && (AND)
* a && (b && c) === (a && b) && c
* m && true = m, true && m = m

bool monoid with || (OR)
* (a || b) || c === a || (b || c)
* m || false = m, false || m = m
